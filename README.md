# The Open Ecosystem Federation

## About

We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia with a shared vision of building an ecosystem toolkit based on open technical standards and a repeatable framework of advice concerning governance, rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.  All ecosystem participants will benefit either by sharing or selling the reasoning they have derived from - or value they have added to - the information available to them.


## Our mission

- maintain an open and collaborative approach across government, industry and academia
- build a set of composable parts comprising an **ecosystem toolkit**
- reduce the cost of moving information, things and people
- permit parties to borrow due diligence and make decisions based on the composition of distributed expertise
- reduce duplication in the storage of information
- reduce duplication of inference over information
- allow rapid decision making and inference over machine readable data
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment
- decrease the cost of administration over valuable and highly re-used insight and information

## The Ecosystem Toolkit

This is a **work in progress** - we are currently working through an eight week [Alpha project](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha).

Links provided in this section at the time of writing will point to artefacts under development during the Alpha project.

OEF will deliver an open Ecosystem Toolkit comprising two parts:

* A [**technical specification**](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha/wiki/Draft-Specification)
* A repeatable governance framework we are calling the [**rules of engagement**](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha/wiki/Draft-RoE)


## Motivation
