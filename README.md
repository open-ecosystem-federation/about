# The Open Ecosystem Federation

## About

We are a federation of parties across Central Government, the private sector and academia with a shared vision of building a framework based on open standards and rules for exchanging machine readable data.  All ecosystem participants will benefit either by sharing or selling the reasoning they have derived from the available data. 

## Motivation

Data is not the new oil, but rather more akin to the new plastic, where the current point to point paradigm for information exchange necessitates the retention of enormous amounts of data with little opportunity for data exploitation beyond the immediate point to point relationship.  

An immediate example that offers significant and easily realisable value, is in the cross border supply chain space, where, once the OEF standard is adopted, participants in a supply chain consuming and presenting machine readable semantically interpretable events according to the agreed ecosystem rules, can significantly reduce the cost of the supply chain, while at the same time unlock previously unrealisable value opportunities through potential sale of expertise and data.  

Applicable across a wide range of ecosystems, from cross border supply chains to distributed ecosystems of trust and identity, the ability to improve process and automatic reasoning, and the confidence inherent in the automatic corroboration of multiple data sources, will lay the foundation on top of which the next generation economy can be built. 


## Our mission

- maintain an open and collaborative approach across government, industry and academia
- reduce the cost of moving information, things and people
- permit parties to borrow due diligence and make decisions based on the composition of distributed expertise
- reduce duplication in the storage of information
- allow rapid decision making and inference over machine readable data
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment
- decrease the cost of administration over valuable and highly re-used insight and information
