# The Open Ecosystem Federation

## About

We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia with a shared vision of building an ecosystem toolkit based on open technical standards and a repeatable framework of advice concerning governance, rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.  All ecosystem participants will benefit either by sharing or selling the reasoning they have derived from - or value they have added to - the information available to them.


## Our mission

- maintain an open and collaborative approach across government, industry and academia
- build a set of composable parts comprising an **ecosystem toolkit**
- reduce the cost of moving information, things and people
- permit parties to borrow due diligence and make decisions based on the composition of distributed expertise
- reduce duplication in the storage of information
- reduce duplication of inference over information
- allow rapid decision making and inference over machine readable data
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment
- decrease the cost of administration over valuable and highly re-used insight and information

## The Ecosystem Toolkit

This is a **work in progress** - we are currently working through an eight week [Alpha project](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha).

Links provided in this section at the time of writing will point to artefacts under development during the Alpha project.

OEF will deliver an open Ecosystem Toolkit comprising two parts:

* A [**technical specification**](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha/wiki/Draft-Specification)
* A repeatable governance framework we are calling the [**rules of engagement**](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha/wiki/Draft-RoE)


## Motivation

See [motivation](motivation) for more background on why we are doing this.


## The Federation

### Core members

Core members are participants who either founded the OEF or who when eligible have been voted into core membership status.

Any participant may be eligible for core membership based on contribution and general agreement between existing core members.

At the time of writing the core members are:

- Factern
- Food Standards Agency (FSA)
- Future Borders
- HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)

### Participants

- Government Digital Service (GDS)
- Idemia
- [Recruiting...]


## OEF Governance

Our hypotheses for OEF governance will be proved/disproved by the OIX Alpha project.  At this time they are outlined below.

1) Project administration, communications and collaboration within the Federation, onboarding and offboarding over OEF membership are all handled using Github and Github accounts.  Typically members are recommended in.

2) The OEF core members will define the tiered entitlements of additional members

3) Core members will need >= 75% majority to make decisions on onboarding and offboarding of participants

4) Core members will need >= 75% majority to vote participants into core membership status
