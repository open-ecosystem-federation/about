# The Open Ecosystem Federation

## About

We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia with a shared vision of building an ecosystem toolkit based on open technical standards and a repeatable framework of advice concerning governance, rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.  All ecosystem participants will benefit either by sharing or selling the reasoning they have derived from - or value they have added to - the information available to them.


## Our mission

- maintain an open and collaborative approach across government, industry and academia
- build a set of composable parts comprising an [**ecosystem toolkit**](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/federated-events-attributes-reasoning-alpha)
- reduce the cost of moving information, things and people
- permit parties to borrow due diligence and make decisions based on the composition of distributed expertise
- reduce duplication in the storage of information
- reduce duplication of inference over information
- allow rapid decision making and inference over machine readable data
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment
- decrease the cost of administration over valuable and highly re-used insight and information

## Motivation

See [motivation](motivation) for more background on why we are doing this.
