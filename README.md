# The Open Ecosystem Federation

## About

A federation of parties exchanging semantically interpretable events, attributes and distributed expressions of reasoning in wide-ranging ecosystems to harmonise the value in their respective business processes. We are building the next generation economy.

Data is not the new oil, it is an unrefined, toxic tsunami and in this current point to point paradigm exchanging as much of it as we seem intent on is both harmful, and thankfully so inefficient and ineffective as to be impossible.

There are so many sources of expertise to be tapped into, organisations and individuals.  Let them keep their data, we can borrow the expertise they already apply over it.  This will decrease the incidence of security and privacy problems, not to mention help avoid territorial or mandate concerns.


## Our mission

- maintain an open and collaborative approach across government, industry and academia
- reduce the cost of moving information, things and people
- permit parties to borrow due diligence and make decisions based on the composition of distributed expertise
- reduce duplication in the storage of information
- reduce duplication in inference over information
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment
- decrease the cost of administration over valuable and highly re-used insight and information
